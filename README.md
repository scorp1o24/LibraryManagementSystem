Project Name: Library Management System


Description:
This is a basic Java implementation of a Library Management System. The project includes classes for managing library items like books, CDs, DVDs, and a generic library item class. Users can borrow, return items, and perform basic inventory management.


Classes:

Book.java

Represents a book with specific attributes like title, author, and ISBN.

CD.java

Defines a CD with details such as title, artist, and duration.

DVD.java

Represents a DVD with information like title, director, and duration.

ItemType.java

Enumerates the types of library items, including BOOK, CD, and DVD.

Library.java

Manages the library inventory, allowing users to borrow and return items.

LibraryItem.java

A generic class representing common attributes of library items.

Main.java

The main class containing the entry point for the Library Management System.


Key Features:

Implementation of a generic LibraryItem class for common attributes.
Specific classes for books, CDs, and DVDs, each with unique characteristics.
The Library class manages the overall inventory and user interactions.
Utilization of enums for defining item types.


Note: This project serves as a basic demonstration and was created a while ago. It does not fully showcase my current competencies. I plan to replace it soon with a more advanced project that reflects my current skills and knowledge.
